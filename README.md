# AIChatBot
Repository for an AI powered chatbot made for my own JavaScript practice as a solo project.

<p>This AI Chatbot is powered by the OpenAI API which is owned by OpenAI. This chatbot is a fully functional chatbot which will answer your questions accordingly in an efficient manner. You will have to have a good internet connection to use this bot and the OpenAI API is not free after a some months of use so you will have to pay to use it further. It can also be integrated easily to another project to have the chatbot functionality. </p>
